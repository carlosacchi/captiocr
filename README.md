# 🖥️ CaptiOCR - Real-Time Screen Text Extraction

[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/CarloSacchi/CaptiOCR)](https://github.com/CarloSacchi/CaptiOCR/releases/latest)
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/carlosacchi/captiocr/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql/badge.svg)](https://github.com/carlosacchi/captiocr/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql)

**CaptiOCR** is an open-source **real-time screen text extraction tool** designed to capture and transcribe captions (subtitles) from video conferencing applications like **Microsoft Teams**, **Zoom**, and **Google Meet**. With an intuitive interface and powerful OCR capabilities, you can select any screen area and extract text continuously in real-time.

> 🔒 **Security & privacy**: CaptiOCR runs entirely on your machine and does
> not transmit captures to any server. It registers a global `Ctrl+Q` hotkey
> to stop capture (no other keystrokes are observed). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
> and [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the full disclosure and how to verify
> released artifacts (SHA256 + GitHub build provenance).

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the application:
```bash
python CaptiOCR.py
```

### **Basic Usage:**

1️⃣ **Select Language** - Choose your OCR language from the dropdown  
2️⃣ **Click "Start (Select Area)"** - Open the area selection tool  
3️⃣ **Drag to Select** - Draw a rectangle around the text area you want to capture  
4️⃣ **Press ENTER** - Begin real-time text extraction  
5️⃣ **Press Ctrl+Q or STOP** - End the capture session  
6️⃣ **Name Your Capture** - Save with a custom filename  

📁 **Output:** Captured text is saved in the `captures/` folder as timestamped `.txt` files.

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### **Optimizing OCR Accuracy**
- **Language Selection**: Choose the correct language model for best results with accents and special characters
- **Capture Area**: Select narrow, wide rectangles focusing on subtitle regions
- **Minimum Size**: Ensure capture areas are at least 50×50 pixels
- **Stable Areas**: Target regions where text appears consistently

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Close unnecessary applications** to reduce system load
- **Use specific language models** rather than auto-detection
- **Regular cleanup** of old capture files and logs
- **Monitor system resources** during extended capture sessions
